- Analysis of Bias/Variance tradeoff on a quadratic function with Gaussian noise. Analysed the effect of model complexity, sample size and lambda(regularizer) on Bias and variance.  

- Implemented linear ridge regression and kernel ridge regression and executed it on a regression problem: 'U.S. county votes cast in the 1980 presidential election'[1] to predict votes cast. Tested for various hyper-parameter values and different types of kernels.
