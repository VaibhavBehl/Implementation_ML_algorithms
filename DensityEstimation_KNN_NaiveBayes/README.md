- Implemented density estimation for 'hw1progde.mat' dataset which contains two sets of data points, x_tr and x_te, which are i.i.d generated from the same unknown univariate probability density of the unit interval, i.e., between 0 and 1.  

- Implemented Naive Bayes and KNN for classification on 'Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame Dataset'[1] and 'Nursery Dataset'[2], and the comparison of their performance with Matlab's built-in Decision Tree function.
