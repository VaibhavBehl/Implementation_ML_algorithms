5.1 Matlab implementation for density estimation on 'hw1progde.mat' which contains two sets of data points, x_tr and x_te, which are i.i.d generated from the same unknown univariate probability density of the unit interval, i.e., between 0 and 1.

5.2 Matlab implementation of Naive Bayes and KNN for classification on 'Tic-Tac-Toe Endgame Dataset' (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
datasets/Tic-Tac-Toe+Endgame) and Nursery Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Nursery, only for Naive Bayes), and the comparison of their performance with Matlab's build in Decision Tree function.
