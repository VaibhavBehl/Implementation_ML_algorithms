- Implemented Logistic Regression and executed it on 'Titanic Dataset'[1] to analyse the factors responsible for a passenger's survival and report the accuracy of our algorithm.  
Started by plotting relationship and calculating mutual information between dependent variable and each independent vairable. Then, handled missing information by two ways- Multiple Models and Substituting Values. After that, did basis expansion and sequential feature selection to select top 10 features with the help of 'glmfit'. Finally, implemented Batch Gradient descent and Newton's method and reported time/accuracy for both methods.
